# terraform-provider-alertlogic

This is a Terraform provider for the [Alert Logic Cloud Insights API](https://console.cloudinsight.alertlogic.com/api/#/).

This is in _very early_ development and only supports a few of the [myriad of endpoints](https://console.cloudinsight.alertlogic.com/api/#/) of the API. Expect the API here to break often during early development.

## Usage

You can find usage examples in the [Terraform registry entry for this provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/duffn/alertlogic/latest/docs).

## Thanks

The [Terraform provider docs and tutorials are good](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/provider-setup), but also a big thanks to these two projects which gave me much inspiration.
